# 🥁 Polyrhythms Visualizer

This project is a **JavaScript-based polyrhythm visualizer and sound generator**, built to explore fundamental and advanced JS concepts such as animation with Canvas, math for rhythmic timing, and audio generation using the Web Audio API.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is both **educational and creative** — to learn deeper JavaScript techniques by building a fully interactive musical tool from scratch.

## 💡 Features

- ⭕ **Canvas-based animation** for visualizing polyrhythms in real time
- 🎵 **Sound generation** using `AudioContext` and oscillators
- 🧠 **Custom logic and math** to calculate timing intervals for different rhythm layers
- 🎛️ Configurable number of beats for each track (e.g., 3:2, 5:4, etc.)
- 🔄 Smooth looping and synchronized beat playback

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **Canvas API**
- **Web Audio API**

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Working with the `<canvas>` API for custom visuals and real-time drawing
- Using the `AudioContext` interface for generating procedural sound
- Building an animation loop using `requestAnimationFrame`
- Applying **modular arithmetic and time-based scheduling** for polyrhythms
- Structuring code for better reusability and logic separation

## 🚀 Getting Started
